# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

PetWatcher-API is currently in development, and although the current API version is _v1_, there has not been publicly
available release. Therefore, all currently available versions are not yet supported and should not be used in any
productive environment.

| Version | Supported                  |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| < 1.0   | :x: (until further notice) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As it cannot be guaranteed that the currently available source code is not used somewhere, all security related issues that
cover design flaws, vulnerabilities, etc. should be handled in such a way, that no actively used instance of PetWatcher-API
is endangered. 

**Please do not use GitHub Issues to report security vulnerabilities as they are publicly available and would result in a
direct disclosure.**

Please contact the development team in private at contact@petwatcher.app if necessary.

## Disclosure Handling
PetWatcher-API is committed to timely review and respond to requests. The development team will inform the public about
security vulnerabilities as soon as a fix is available.
