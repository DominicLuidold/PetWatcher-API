PetWatcher-API is a REST API built with the latest technologies and security concepts in mind and aims to provide a set
of functionalities for managing any desired amount of pets and homes the pets live in.

At first, this might sound like a weird thing for an API and subsequent end-user applications (such as apps, etc.) but
rest assured, once you have more than two cats, for example, or are responsible for taking care of your friends' pets,
PetWatcher-API comes in handy. Ever wondered how *Crazy Cat Lady* keeps an eye on so many cats? Now you know!

## Installation & Usage
PetWatcher-API is currently under heavy development, and it is **not recommended** to install or even run the API until
its very first release. In addition, the database schema is currently also not yet fully decided upon and will change
regularly.

There is currently no publicly available API documentation but PetWatcher-API aims to provide a detailed and concise
documentation adhering to the [OpenAPI specification](https://openapis.org) for the first as well as upcoming releases.

If you would like to test the API before the first release or give feedback, please reach out to contact@petwatcher.app.

## Configuration
An explanation on how to configure PetWatcher-API will follow once the project has reached a level where an actual usage
is feasible.
